¡°If I¡¯m going to go down, I¡¯m going to go down my way, leading this team. This team is going to have my personality. It¡¯s going to have my grit. They¡¯re going to have my fight. They¡¯re going to have my will. They¡¯re going to have my competitive spirit. So when we step on that basketball court, you¡¯re not just facing me and my competitive fire, you¡¯re facing 12 of those.

 

¡°For me it is that ferocity or that anger, that rage, and I can carry that with me. Now, it became, How do I instill this into the rest of my teammates?

 

¡°Using the darker emotions. The anger or resentment or frustration, and sadness and using that as a weapon. Using that as a form of offense. It¡¯s a scar, it¡¯s pain, it¡¯s a bad memory.

 

¡°Some people are afraid to tap into that side of them, but it¡¯s such a powerful thing. Once they own it themselves, then the sky is the limit because they are going to drive themselves and pull it from who they are and all of their life experiences and things that have motivated them.

 

¡°They had to embrace the villain nature that¡¯s in all of us. I gave them a platform to unleash.
